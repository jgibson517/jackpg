## Hi, there!

My name is Jack. 

Currently, I'm an engineer for the Minnesota Timberwolves. There I write code to help inform basketball decisions. Previously, I was a graduate student in the University of Chicago's [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program.

I'm also a past contributor to the [Data and Democracy Lab](https://mggg.org/) (formerly know as the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group).

See the [about](/about) page for a more detailed description of my work history. Select projects (personal and open-source) can be found at [projects](/projects). Some of the music I listen to is featured in [records](/records). I also plan to start writing stuff down here, and when I do you can read it in [words](/words).
