## Projects

I'm a programmer and researcher. On this page you can find select examples of both software and research I've contributed to. 

These days, I work mostly in code. Please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/jgibson517) to see what I'm actively working on. 

## Software

Django application to promote access to and analyis of public comments on federal legislation. Features data pipelines to automatically collect comments from GSA along with natural langauge processsing to analyze sentiment and themes of public comments. Built in collaboration with peers from the University of Chicago for James Turk's Software Engineering for Civic Tech [course](https://capp30320.jpt.sh/).
