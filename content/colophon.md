### What is this?

This my personal site. It's primarily used to document my work, but I included some personal stuff too as motivation to keep maintaining it.

### Who is Jack Gibson?

Great question! You can learn more about me [here](/about). 

### How is this built?

This site is a built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a tool that lets you spin markdown into minimalist websites. It's design is inspired by many similar websites out there, but primarily from Ben Hoyt's wonderful [writing](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) on the small web. 

It's design is a customized version of [hugo-bearblog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/), with slight modifications to its layout and color schemes.
